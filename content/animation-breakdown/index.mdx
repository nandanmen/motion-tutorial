title: Animation Breakdown
---

Great work! There you have it â€” your first animation with Framer
Motion. Before we move on, let's break down that animation. How did we
go from the `animate` prop to the animation you see on the right?

Here's the code from before:

```jsx
import { motion } from "framer-motion";

export function Box() {
  return (
    <motion.div
      animate={{
        y: 500,
      }}
    />
  );
}
```
